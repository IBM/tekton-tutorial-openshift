# 7. Run the Pipeline

All the pieces are in place to execute the pipelinerun by creating the PipelineRun resource in your cluster.

```bash
$ oc create -f tekton/run/picalc-pipeline-run.yaml
pipelinerun.tekton.dev/picalc-pr-c7hsb created
```

Note that we're using `oc create` here instead of `oc apply`. As mentioned before, a given PipelineRun resource can run a pipeline only once, so you need to create a new PipelineRun each time you want to run the Pipeline. `kubectl` or `oc` will create the generated name of the PipelineRun resource.

View the status of our pipeline run,

```bash
$ oc get pipelinerun
NAME              SUCCEEDED   REASON    STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
picalc-pr-dqwqb   Unknown     Running   5s
```

The pipeline will be successful when `SUCCEEDED` is `True`.

```bash
$ oc get pipelinerun
NAME              SUCCEEDED   REASON      STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
picalc-pr-x5qf9   True        Succeeded   2m58s       12s
```

Check the status of the Kubernetes deployment.  It should be ready.

```bash
$ oc get deploy picalc
NAME     READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
picalc   1/1     1            1           9m
```

You can curl the application using its NodePort service.
First display the nodes and choose one of the node's external IP addresses.
Then display the service to get its NodePort.

```bash
EXTERNAL_IP=$(oc get nodes -o wide -o json | jq -r '.items[0].status.addresses | .[] | select( .type=="ExternalIP" ) | .address ')
echo $EXTERNAL_IP

NODE_PORT=$(oc get svc picalc -n $NAMESPACE --output json | jq -r '.spec.ports[0].nodePort' )
echo $NODE_PORT

$ curl $EXTERNAL_IP:$NODE_PORT?iterations=20000000
3.1415926036
```

## Debugging a failed PipelineRun

Let's take a look at what a PipelineRun failure would look like.
Edit the PipelineRun yaml and change the gitUrl parameter to a non-existent Git repository to force a failure.
Then create a new PipelineRun and describe it after letting it run for a minute or two.

```bash
$ oc create -f tekton/run/picalc-pipeline-run.yaml
pipelinerun.tekton.dev/picalc-pr-sk7md created

$ tkn pipelinerun describe picalc-pr-sk7md
Name:              picalc-pr-sk7md
Namespace:         default
Pipeline Ref:      build-and-deploy-pipeline
Service Account:   pipeline-account

```

The output tells us that the `clone-repo` pipeline task failed.  The `Message` also tells us how to get the logs from the pod which was used to run the task:

```bash
for logs run: kubectl -n default logs picalc-pr-sk7md-clone-repo-8gs25-pod-v7fg8 -c step-clone
```

If you run that `kubectl logs` command you will see that there is a failure trying to fetch the non-existing Git repository.

An even easier way to get the logs from a PipelineRun is to use the `tkn` CLI.

```bash
tkn pipelinerun logs picalc-pr-sk7md-clone-repo-8gs25-pod-v7fg8 -t clone-repo
```

If you omit the `-t` flag then the command will get the logs for all pipeline tasks that executed.

You can also get the logs for the last PipelineRun for a particular Pipeline using this command:

```bash
tkn pipeline logs build-and-deploy-pipeline -L
```

You should delete a PipelineRun when you no longer have a need to reference its logs.  Deleting the PipelineRun deletes the pods that were used
to run the pipeline tasks.

## Check it out in OpenShift Console

OpenShift provides a nice UI for the pipelines and the applications deployed. From the OpenShift console, click **developer** in the upper left drop-down to get to the developer view. Then click **Topology** to view your running app.

## Summary

Tekton provides simple, easy-to-learn features for constructing CI/CD pipelines that run on Kubernetes. This tutorial covered the basics to get you started building your own pipelines. There are more features available and many more planned for upcoming releases.
