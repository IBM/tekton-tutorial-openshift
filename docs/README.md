## Introduction

In this learning path you learn:

* the basic concepts in Tekton pipelines,
* how to create a pipeline to build an image and deploy a container,
* how to run the pipeline, check its status and troubleshoot problems,
* how to `Shift Left` security and include security checks into your pipeline,
* add Static Application Secuirty Testing (SAST),
* add Software Component Analysis (SCA),
* push images to a private repository,
* sign images,
* scan images for vulnerabilities,
* scan running containers for vulnerabilities,
* check compliance of your deployments against NIST 850-3 and SOC2 regulations,

## About Tekton

[Tekton](https://tekton.dev) is an open-source framework for creating CI/CD pipelines. Tekton is governed by the [Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF)](https://cd.foundation), which includes among other the following special interest groups:

* Best practices,
* Interoperability,
* MLOps,
* Security.

Tekton provides a set of extensions of the Kubernetes API for defining pipelines, in the form of [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/). Tekton consists of about 15 projects like Pipelines, Triggers, Results, Chains, Operator, Catalog, Dashboard, CLI and Hub.

The following diagram shows the basic resources in Tekton.

The resources are used as follows.

* A **PipelineRun** defines an execution of a pipeline. It references the **Pipeline** to run.
* A **Pipeline** defines the set of **Tasks** that compose a pipeline.
* A **Task** defines a set of build steps such as compiling code, running tests, and building and deploying images.

A Task executes a Pod and is a sequence of Steps. A Step is equivalent to a Container. You can define the name, image, environment and a script to run inside the container.  All Steps in a Task can access a shared workspace, an implicit volume of the pod.

A Pipeline is a collection of Tasks that can run sequentially or conditionally. Pipeline has access to a shared persistent volume (workspace) and combines tasks through the workspace and results to certain output. The pipeline also provides a finalizer function.

Pipeline and Tasks are executed by PipelineRun and TaskRun. To automatically invoke these you can create a Trigger. A TriggerBinding extracts data from the event payload, and a TriggerTemplate creates the template for the PipelineRun. The EventListener is a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) that combines the TriggerBinding and the TriggerTemplate. You can find existing pipeline resources in the Tekton Catalog or Tekton Hub.
